            <h2>Prerequisite</h2>
            <p>
                Before performing this experiment, student must have knowledge about:
            <ol>
                <li>Working of a typical Capacitor.</li>
                <li>Types of Capacitors.</li>
                <li>Effect of various factors that affect the output of a capacitor e.g. temperature, dielectric
                    constant of insulator used, distance between the plates, are of the plates used, etc..</li>

            <h2>Level measurements</h2>
            </li>
            </ol>
            <p>In industry, liquids such as water, chemicals, and solvents are used in various processes. The amount of
                such liquid stored can be found by measuring level of the liquid in a container or vessel. The level
                affects not only the quantity delivered but also pressure and rate of flow in and out of the container.
                Level sensors detect the level of substances like liquids, slurries, granular materials, and powders.
                The substance to be measured can be inside a container or can be in its natural form (e.g. a river or a
                lake). The level measurement can be either continuous or point values.</p>
            <p><strong>Continuous level sensors</strong> measure the level to determine the exact amount of substance in
                a continuous manner.</p>
            <p><strong>Point-level sensors</strong> indicate whether the substance is above or below the sensing point.
                This is essential to avoid overflow or emptying of tanks and to protect pumps from dry run.</p>
            <p>The selection criteria for level sensor include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The physical phase (liquid, solid or slurry)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Temperature

            </ul>
            <p>From the application point of view the considerations are :</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Price</li>
                <li>Accuracy</li>

                <li>Monitoring or control of continuous or discrete levels</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Level measurements are broadly classified in two groups:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Direct methods</li>
                <li>Indirect methods</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>In direct methods</strong>, the level is indicated directly by means of simple mechanical
                devices. The measurement is not affected by changes in material density. Few examples are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dip Stick</li>
                <li>Resistance Tapes</li>
                <li>Sight Glass</li>
                <li>Floats</li>
                <li>Ultrasonic </li>
                <li>Radar</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>In Indirect methods</strong>, the level is converted in a measurable signal using a suitable
                transducer. Change in the material affects the measurement. A corrective factor must be used in
                recalibrating the instrument. Few examples are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hydrostatic head methods</li>
                <li>Load cell</li>
                <li>Capacitance</li>
                <li>Conductivity</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Capacitance Level Measurement:</em>
                Capacitive level transducer is an example of indirect measurement of level</p>
            <div class="center-content"><img src="../../images/Capacitive-Level-Measurement.png" alt=""></div>
          

            <p>Capacitance level sensors are used for wide variety of solids, aqueous and organic liquids, and slurries.
                The technique is frequently referred as RF as radio frequency signals applied to the capacitance
                circuit. The sensors can be designed to sense material with dielectric constants as low as 1.1 (coke and
                fly ash) and as high as 88 (water) or more. Sludges and slurries such as dehydrated cake and sewage
                slurry (dielectric constant approx. 50) and liquid chemicals such as quicklime (dielectric constant
                approx. 90) can also be sensed. Dual-probe capacitance level sensors can also be used to sense the
                interface between two immiscible liquids with substantially different dielectric constants.</p>
            <p>Since capacitance level sensors are electronic devices, phase modulation and the use of higher
                frequencies makes the sensor suitable for applications in which dielectric constants are similar.</p>
            <p><strong>Working Principle:</strong>
                The principle of capacitive level measurement is based on change of capacitance. An insulated electrode
                acts as one plate of capacitor and the tank wall (or reference electrode in a non-metallic vessel) acts
                as the other plate. The capacitance depends on the fluid level. An empty tank has a lower capacitance
                while a filled tank has a higher capacitance.
                A simple capacitor consists of two electrode plate separated by a small thickness of an insulator such
                as solid, liquid, gas, or vacuum. This insulator is also called as dielectric. Value of C depends on
                dielectric used, area of the plate and also distance between the plates.</p>
            <pre><code>      C = E (K A/d)                                            
          </code></pre>
            <p>Where:
                C = capacitance in picofarads (pF)
                E = a constant known as the absolute permittivity of free space
                K = relative dielectric constant of the insulating material
                A = effective area of the conductors
                d = distance between the conductors
                This change in capacitance can be measured using AC bridge.</p>
            <p><strong>Measurement:</strong>
                Measurement is made by applying an RF signal between the conductive probe and the vessel wall. The RF
                signal results in a very low current flow through the dielectric process material in the tank from the
                probe to the vessel wall. When the level in the tank drops, the dielectric constant drops causing a drop
                in the capacitance reading and a minute drop in current flow. This change is detected by the level
                switch's internal circuitry and translated into a change in the relay state of the level switch in case
                of point level detection. In the case of continuous level detectors, the output is not a relay state,
                but a scaled analog signal.</p>
            <p> Level Measurement can be divided into three categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Measurement of non-conductive material</li>
                <li>Measurement of conductive material</li>
                <li>Non-contact measurement</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Non-conducting material:</strong>
                For measuring level of non conducting liquids, bare probe arrangement is used as liquid resistance is
                sufficiently high to make it dielectric. Since the electrode and tank are fixed in place, the distance
                (d) is constant, capacitance is directly proportional to the level of the material acting as dielectric.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Conducting Material:</strong>
                In conducting liquids, the probe plates are insulated using thin coating of glass or plastic to avoid
                short circuiting. The conductive material acts as the ground plate of the capacitor.</p>
            <p>Proximity measurements (Non-contact type measurements):
                In Proximity level measurement is the area of the capacitance plates is fixed, but distance between
                plates varies. Proximity level measurement does not produce a linear output and are used when the level
                varies by several inches.</p>

            <h2>Applications</h2>
            <p>Capacitance Level Probes are used for measuring level of</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Liquids</li>
                <li>Powered and granular solids</li>
                <li>liquid metals at very high temperature</li>

                can be a problem due to their very low dielectric constants (caused by the large amount of air space
                between particles).</p>
