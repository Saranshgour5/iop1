    <h2 class="experiment-heading">Characaterize The LVDT</h2>

    <div class="main-content">
    <h2>Prerequisite</h2>
    <p>
        Student must be well versed with
        <ol>
      <li>The basics of transformers</li>
      <li>Magnetic materials and their properties</li>
      <li>Concept of inductance and mutual inductance</li>
    </ol>
    LVDT is linear Variable Differential Transformer. It is electromechanical transducer. It converts the rectilinear displacement of any object to which it is coupled mechanically in electrical signal proportional to it.
    </p>
    <h2>Construction</h2>
    <p>LVDT is made of two main components: the movable armature and the outer transformer windings. LVDT consists of 3 windings. Centre one is Primary winding while the other two are secondary windings. The secondary's are identical and placed symmetrical about the primary. The secondary coils are connected in series-opposition. Moving element of LVDT is called core. It is a cylindrical armature made of ferromagnetic material. It is free to move along the axis of the tube. At one end, the core is coupled to an object whose displacement is to be measured, while the other end moves freely inside the coil's hollow bore.</p>
    <h2>Working</h2>
    <p>An alternating current is connected to the primary. This current must be of appropriate amplitude and frequency. It is also called as Primary Excitation. The frequency is usually in the range 1 to 10 kHz. This current causes a voltage to be induced in each secondary proportional to its mutual inductance with the primary. While the frequency of induced voltage is same as that of excitation frequency, its amplitude varies with the position of the iron core. As the core moves, the voltages induced in the secondary's changes due to change in mutual inductance. The coils are connected in series but in opposite phase , so that the output voltage is the difference between the two secondary voltages. When the core is exactly at central position, i.e at equal distance from the two secondary's, equal but opposite voltages are induced in these two coils, so the output voltage is zero. When the core is displaced in one direction, the voltage in one coil increases with respect to the other, causing the output voltage to increase from zero to a maximum value. This voltage is in phase with the primary voltage. When the core moves in the other direction, the output voltage also increases from zero to a maximum value, but the phase is opposite to that of the primary. The magnitude of the output voltage is proportional to the distance moved by the core. The phase of the voltage indicates the direction of the displacement.
    </p>
    <h2>Application</h2>
    <p>LVDTs are commonly used for
        <ol>
            <li>Position feedback in servomechanisms</li>
            <li>Automated measurement in machine tools and many other industrial and scientific applications.</li>
            <li>Measurement of displacement ranging from fraction of mm to cm</li>
            <li>Acting as a secondary transducer, it can be used for force, weight and pressure measurement.</li>
        </ol>
